		<h1>University of Pittsburgh Social Media Campaign</h1>
		<p>Together, let's make sure Pitt's brand flows across all social media platforms and makes the school as desireable as possible.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>Basically...</h2>
		<p>Social media reigns supreme in today's society, as most teenagers and young adults have Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc.</p>
		
		<h2>Reasons why this project matters...</h2>
		<h3>...and why you should want to be a part of this team</h3>

		<ol>
  			<li>This project will make it easier for both applicants and students to search through Pitt's social media archives.</li>
  			<li>Pitt is known for being one step ahead of the game... what other school has an outlet where all of their social media is featured in one place?</li>
  			<li>Social media is trending right now, and I do not see this trend going anywhere for a long time.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>To help get everyone pumped about this project, let's think of some reasons why Pitt rocks and why our school's social media game needs to ROCK.</p></center>
		<p><strong>Choose from the options below, or call out some other ideas!</strong></p>
		
		<form name="Pitt Rocks">
		<select name="Pitt Rocks menu" id="PittMenu" width="auto">
				<option value="#">Hail to Pitt.</option>
				<option value="#">The University of Pittsburgh's campus is the perfect combination of urban and suburban.</option>
				<option value="#">The best food in Pittsburgh is on campus, near campus, or just a *free* bus ride away.</option>
				<option value="#">Pitt has amazing academics, sports, social organizations, and so much more.</option>
				<option value="#">It is just the best school, no questions asked!</option>
		</select>
		</aside>
		
		<h2>So, what elements am I thinking of including?</h2>
		<p>To start, this project needs to bring together information from most- if not all- of Pitt's social media.</p>
		<p>This includes various sections dedicated to the most popular platforms, including YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.</p>
		<p>...We can even compose our own images and sound to include in a different section!</p>
		<p>The main focus would be on the most recent posts, therefore everyone can easily stay up to date with the happenings at Pitt on a daily basis.</p>
		<p>In this way, we can guarantee Pitt's fairly new re-branding works well with a select target audience.</p>
		
		<p><em><strong>Sometimes, you need to bring things to other people's attention to get them to actually pay attention.</strong></em></p>
